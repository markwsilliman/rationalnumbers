## Introduction

Learn how math can help you win the Monty Hall game show. Explore probabilities, choices, and why switching doors doubles your chances of winning!

## MIDDLE SCHOOL: How Math Can Help You Win a Game Show: The Monty Hall Problem

Imagine you’re a contestant on a game show. There are three doors in front of you. Behind one door is a brand-new car, but behind the other two doors are goats. You don’t know what’s behind any of the doors, but you get to choose one.

After you pick a door, the host—who knows what’s behind the doors—opens a different door, revealing a goat. Then the host asks, “Do you want to stick with your first choice, or switch to the other unopened door?”

What should you do? Stick with your original door or switch? The answer might surprise you—and math has the solution!

---

### **1. Understanding the Problem**

At first, it might seem like it doesn’t matter if you switch or stay. After all, there are two doors left, so you might think the car is equally likely to be behind either one. But math shows that switching actually gives you a **better chance of winning**. Let’s find out why.

---

### **2. Your Chances When You Pick a Door**

When you first pick a door, you have no information about where the car is. That means you have:

$$
\mathbf{P(car \ behind \ your \ door) = \frac{1}{3}}
$$

This is because there’s one car and three doors, so the chance of the car being behind any one door is $$\frac{1}{3}$$.

---

### **3. What Happens When the Host Opens a Door**

After you pick a door, the host opens another door with a goat behind it. The host **will never open the door with the car**, and this is what makes the game so interesting! The act of opening a door changes the situation.

If the car wasn’t behind your first choice (which happens $$\frac{2}{3}$$ of the time), switching will always win because the host has removed a losing option.

---

### **4. Breaking It Down: Why Switching Is Better**

To see why switching works, let’s look at all the possibilities:

- **Case 1**: The car is behind the door you picked.

  - Probability: $$\frac{1}{3}$$.
  - If you switch, you lose.

- **Case 2**: The car is behind one of the other two doors.
  - Probability: $$\frac{2}{3}$$.
  - The host will always open a door with a goat, leaving the car behind the other unopened door. If you switch, you win.

So, if you stick with your first choice, you win $$\frac{1}{3}$$ of the time. But if you switch, you win $$\frac{2}{3}$$ of the time!

---

### **5. Visualizing the Odds**

Let’s imagine you play the game 300 times. Here’s what would happen on average:

- If you stick with your first choice:  
  $$\mathbf{300 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 100 \ wins}$$
- If you always switch:  
  $$\mathbf{300 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 200 \ wins}$$

Switching gives you **double the chance of winning**. That’s a big advantage!

---

### **6. Why It Matters**

The Monty Hall Problem teaches us to think carefully about probabilities. Even when something seems like an even chance, more information can shift the odds. This lesson doesn’t just apply to game shows—it’s useful in making decisions in real life. For example:

- Should you take another shot at a test question you’re unsure about?
- Should you try a different strategy in a video game?

By understanding probabilities, you can make smarter choices.

---

### **Challenge Problem for You**

You’re playing a version of the Monty Hall game with 4 doors instead of 3. After you choose one door, the host opens a door with a goat and asks if you want to switch. If you switch, the host lets you pick from the 2 remaining doors. What’s the probability of winning if you switch?

---

Math helps us make better decisions—even in gameshows. Who knows? Maybe one day you’ll use what you’ve learned to win big!

## HIGH SCHOOL: The Monty Hall Problem: Using Math to Win a Game Show

Imagine you’re on a game show with a chance to win a car. There are three doors in front of you. Behind one door is the car, and behind the other two doors are goats. You pick a door, but before opening it, the host—who knows what’s behind each door—opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat. Now you’re left with two unopened doors.

The host asks: “Do you want to stick with your original choice or switch to the other door?”  
What should you do to maximize your chances of winning?

This puzzling situation is called the **Monty Hall Problem**, and the answer lies in probability, statistics, and math.

---

### **1. Understanding the Initial Chances**

When you pick a door at the start, your chance of picking the car is:

$$
\mathbf{P(car \ behind \ chosen \ door) = \frac{1}{3}}
$$

The chance that the car is behind one of the other two doors is:

$$
\mathbf{P(car \ behind \ other \ doors) = \frac{2}{3}}
$$

At first, it seems like switching or staying might be a 50-50 choice after one door is opened. But this isn’t true, as we’ll see.

---

### **2. How the Host's Action Changes the Odds**

When the host opens a door to reveal a goat, they’re giving you more information. The host **always opens a door with a goat**, which influences the probabilities. Let’s break it down:

- If the car was behind your initial choice (probability $$\frac{1}{3}$$), switching loses.
- If the car was behind one of the other two doors (probability $$\frac{2}{3}$$), the host’s action ensures the car is behind the door you didn’t pick.

So, if you switch, you win whenever the car wasn’t behind your first choice—an event that happens $$\frac{2}{3}$$ of the time!

---

### **3. Breaking It Down with Conditional Probability**

The Monty Hall Problem can also be explained using **Bayes' Theorem**, which calculates how probabilities update when new information becomes available.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

$$
\mathbf{P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}}
$$

Here:

- $$\mathbf{P(A|B)}$$ is the probability of event $$\mathbf{A}$$ happening given that $$\mathbf{B}$$ happened.
- $$\mathbf{P(A)}$$ is the initial probability of $$\mathbf{A}$$.
- $$\mathbf{P(B|A)}$$ is the probability of $$\mathbf{B}$$ happening if $$\mathbf{A}$$ is true.
- $$\mathbf{P(B)}$$ is the total probability of $$\mathbf{B}$$.

Let:

- $$\mathbf{A}$$ = "The car is behind the door you didn’t pick."
- $$\mathbf{B}$$ = "The host opens a door to reveal a goat."

Using Bayes' Theorem, we find:

$$
\mathbf{P(car \ behind \ other \ door | goat \ revealed) = \frac{P(goat \ revealed | car \ behind \ other \ door) \cdot P(car \ behind \ other \ door)}{P(goat \ revealed)}}
$$

The math confirms that switching increases your chances to $$\frac{2}{3}$$!

### **4. Simulating the Problem**

If the math feels abstract, simulations help make it clear. Let’s say you play the game 1,000 times:

- If you always stick with your first choice, you’ll win roughly $$\mathbf{1,000 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 333}$$ times.
- If you always switch, you’ll win about $$\mathbf{1,000 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 667}$$ times.

This shows that switching is the better strategy.

---

### **5. How This Applies Beyond Game Shows**

The Monty Hall Problem isn’t just about game shows—it’s a lesson in how new information affects probabilities. It teaches you to think critically and reconsider your choices when presented with new evidence. This idea is used in many real-world situations, such as:

- **Medicine**: Doctors use updated probabilities to refine diagnoses based on new test results.
- **Sports Strategy**: Coaches adjust their game plans based on player performance.
- **Decision-Making**: People revise their choices in business or personal life after learning new facts.

---

### **Challenge Problem**

You’re playing a version of the Monty Hall game with four doors instead of three. After you choose one door, the host opens a door with a goat and asks if you want to switch. What’s the probability of winning if you switch?

---

### **Why This Matters**

The Monty Hall Problem demonstrates the power of probability and teaches us how math can lead to smarter decisions. Next time you’re faced with a choice—whether it’s in a game show or in real life—remember how math can guide you to victory!
