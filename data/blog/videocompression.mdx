## MIDDLE SCHOOL: How Math Compresses Videos So You Can Watch in HD

Have you ever wondered how you can stream your favorite shows or watch your favorite streamers in HD without buffering? The secret lies in **video compression**, a process that makes large video files small enough to send over the internet. And guess what? It’s all powered by math!

Let’s explore how math helps make video streaming fast and efficient.

---

### **1. What Is Video Compression?**

A video is made up of many images called **frames** that play quickly, one after another. A single HD video frame can have millions of pixels, and each pixel needs information about its color. That’s a lot of data! Sending all this data over the internet without compression would take forever.

Video compression uses math to reduce the amount of data while keeping the video quality high. It works by removing unnecessary information and finding patterns in the data.

---

### **2. Turning Video Frames into Numbers**

Each frame in a video is stored as a grid of pixels, and each pixel is represented by numbers. For example, a black-and-white image can be turned into a grid like this:

$$
\mathbf{I} =
\begin{bmatrix}
255 & 200 & 180 \\
100 & 50 & 25 \\
10 & 5 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Here, each number represents the brightness of a pixel, with 255 being the brightest and 0 being the darkest. For a color image, each pixel has three numbers (for red, green, and blue), which makes the data even larger!

---

### **3. Removing Unnecessary Data**

One way to compress video is to remove information that the human eye won’t notice. For example:

- The human eye is more sensitive to changes in brightness than changes in color. So, the video can store less color information without affecting how it looks.
- If parts of the image stay the same across several frames, those parts don’t need to be re-sent.

This is called **lossy compression** because some data is removed, but the video still looks good to viewers.

---

### **4. Finding Patterns with Math**

Another trick of video compression is finding patterns in the data. Imagine a straight line in a video frame. Instead of storing information for each pixel in the line, the computer can store a simple formula like:

$$
\mathbf{y = mx + b}
$$

This is the equation for a line, where:

- $$\mathbf{m}$$ is the slope,
- $$\mathbf{b}$$ is where the line crosses the vertical axis.

By storing this formula instead of individual pixel values, the video file becomes much smaller!

---

### **5. Turning Numbers into Codes**

Video compression also uses **codes** to store numbers more efficiently. If certain numbers (like 0s) appear a lot, they can be replaced with shorter codes. This is called **Huffman coding**, and it works like this:

- A frequent number like 0 might be replaced with the code “1”.
- A less frequent number like 255 might be replaced with “1001”.

This saves space because shorter codes are used for numbers that appear more often.

---

### **6. Why Compression Matters**

Without video compression, streaming HD videos would take up too much internet bandwidth. Compression allows platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and Netflix to send high-quality videos quickly to millions of people around the world.

Thanks to math, you can enjoy smooth, HD video while keeping data sizes small.

---

### **Challenge Problem for You**

A video has a frame that is 1920 pixels wide and 1080 pixels tall, with each pixel requiring 3 bytes to store its color. If the video runs at 30 frames per second for 10 seconds, how much data does it use before compression?

Now imagine compression reduces the file size by 90%. How much data is saved?

---

### **Why This Is Cool**

Video compression is an amazing example of how math can solve real-world problems. From equations to clever coding, math makes the magic of streaming possible. Who knows? Maybe one day, you’ll use math to invent the next big thing in video technology!

## HIGH SCHOOL: How Math Compresses Videos So You Can Watch in HD

Have you ever wondered how you can stream HD videos from YouTube, Twitch, or Netflix without waiting hours for them to load? The answer lies in **video compression**, which reduces the size of video files without losing much quality. And at the heart of video compression is math.

Let’s dive into how math helps shrink video files so you can watch your favorite streamers in HD.

---

### **1. Turning Video Frames into Numbers**

A video is made up of thousands of images called **frames**. Each frame is a grid of pixels, and each pixel is represented by numbers. For example, in a grayscale frame, each pixel can be represented like this:

$$
\mathbf{I} =
\begin{bmatrix}
255 & 200 & 180 \\
100 & 50 & 25 \\
10 & 5 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Here, each number represents the brightness of the pixel, from 0 (black) to 255 (white). In a color image, each pixel has three numbers—one each for red, green, and blue.

When you have 1920 × 1080 pixels in each frame, multiplied by 30 frames per second, that’s a lot of data!

---

### **2. Identifying Patterns with Math**

Video compression works by identifying patterns in the data. For example, straight lines can be represented with the equation:

$$
\mathbf{y = mx + b}
$$

This equation saves space because instead of storing every pixel’s brightness, the computer can store the slope ($$\mathbf{m}$$) and intercept ($$\mathbf{b}$$).

Compression also uses trigonometric functions like $$\mathbf{\cos}$$ to simplify repeating patterns. A key tool for this is the **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**, which breaks an image into patterns of waves. A 2D version of the DCT converts a block of pixels into a sum of cosine waves, like this:

$$
\mathbf{F(u,v) = \sum_{x=0}^{N-1} \sum_{y=0}^{N-1} f(x,y) \cos\left[\frac{\pi (2x+1)u}{2N}\right] \cos\left[\frac{\pi (2y+1)v}{2N}\right]}
$$

Here:

- $$\mathbf{f(x,y)}$$ is the pixel brightness at position $$\mathbf{(x,y)}$$.
- $$\mathbf{F(u,v)}$$ represents the compressed data for each wave.
- $$\mathbf{N}$$ is the block size.

This process allows the computer to keep the most important patterns and discard the rest, making the video smaller.

---

### **3. Removing Redundant Information**

Videos often have similar data across multiple frames. For example:

- The background in a livestream stays the same while the streamer moves.
- Only parts of an image change slightly between frames.

Instead of storing the same information repeatedly, compression algorithms calculate the **difference** between frames. This is called **interframe compression**.

The change in pixel positions can be calculated using a simple vector:

$$
\mathbf{\Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r}_{final} - \vec{r}_{initial}}
$$

Here, the algorithm tracks how far pixels move and only stores those differences, saving space.

---

### **4. Using Probability to Encode Data**

Once patterns are identified, the data is further compressed using **statistical coding**. Numbers that appear often (like 0s in the background) are stored with shorter codes, while rare numbers are stored with longer codes. This is called **Huffman coding**.

The efficiency of the compression depends on the probabilities of different numbers appearing. For example, if a pixel’s brightness is more likely to be 0, we assign it a shorter code.

The expected length of the compressed data is calculated using:

$$
\mathbf{E(L) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i) \cdot L(x_i)}
$$

Where:

- $$\mathbf{E(L)}$$ is the expected length of the code,
- $$\mathbf{P(x_i)}$$ is the probability of symbol $$\mathbf{x_i}$$,
- $$\mathbf{L(x_i)}$$ is the length of the code for $$\mathbf{x_i}$$.

This reduces the overall size of the video.

### **5. Why Compression Works**

The main goal of compression is to store the most important information while removing unnecessary details. By using:

- Equations to find patterns,
- Trigonometric functions to simplify data,
- Vectors to track changes between frames,
- Probability to encode data efficiently,

Compression algorithms like H.264 or H.265 can reduce video sizes by 90% or more without noticeable loss of quality.

### **6. Why It Matters**

Without compression, streaming HD videos would require massive amounts of data, causing slow load times and buffering. Thanks to math, platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and Netflix can deliver high-quality video to millions of users in real time.

---

### **Challenge Problem for You**

A video is 1920 pixels wide and 1080 pixels tall, with 30 frames per second. Each pixel requires 3 bytes to store its color.

1. How much data is needed to store 10 seconds of uncompressed video?
2. If the compression reduces the file size by 95%, how much space is saved?
