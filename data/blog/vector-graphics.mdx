## Introduction

If you zoom in too far on a JPG image (also known as raster images), it becomes blurry. But thereâ€™s a way to save images using math, creating visuals that stay sharp no matter how much you zoom!

## MIDDLE SCHOOL: How Is Math Used to Generate Vector Images?

Have you ever seen graphics that stay crisp and clear no matter how much you zoom in? These are called **vector images**, and theyâ€™re made using **math**! Unlike regular pictures, which are made of tiny dots called pixels, vector images are created using shapes, lines, and curves described by mathematical formulas.

Letâ€™s explore how math helps us make these amazing images!

### What Are Vector Images?

A vector image is built using simple shapes like:

- **Lines**
- **Circles**
- **Polygons (shapes with many sides, like triangles or squares)**

Each shape is drawn using math. Instead of saying "color this specific pixel," vector images say "draw a line from this point to this point" or "create a circle with this center and size."

The cool thing about vector images is that they donâ€™t lose quality when you zoom in or resize them. Thatâ€™s because theyâ€™re created with math formulas, not pixels.

### How Does Math Create Vector Images?

#### 1. Placing Points and Drawing Lines

Every shape in a vector image starts with **points**, which are located using **coordinates** on a grid. A point has two numbers:

- $$\mathbf{x}$$ tells us how far across the point is.
- $$\mathbf{y}$$ tells us how far up the point is.

For example, the point $$\mathbf{(3, 2)}$$ is three steps to the right and two steps up from the bottom-left corner of the grid.

To draw a line, we connect two points:

- Start point: $$\mathbf{(x_1, y_1)}$$
- End point: $$\mathbf{(x_2, y_2)}$$

---

#### 2. Making Curves

Curves in vector images are created using special math tools called **BÃ©zier curves**. These curves are controlled by points:

- A **start point** and an **end point** tell us where the curve begins and ends.
- A **control point** shapes the curve by "pulling" it toward itself.

For example, imagine stretching a rubber band between two points. If you pull the band in the middle, it forms a curve. The control point works the same way!

The computer calculates the curve by blending all these points together using math. Designers use these curves to create smooth arcs and shapes.

#### 3. Changing Shapes

Vector graphics are easy to change because theyâ€™re made with math. You can:

- **Move** a shape by changing its coordinates.
- **Resize** a shape by multiplying its size by a number.
- **Rotate** a shape by turning it around a point.

For example:

- If a square starts at $$\mathbf{(2, 3)}$$, moving it 2 steps right and 1 step up changes its position to $$\mathbf{(4, 4)}$$.
- If a circle has a size of 5, multiplying its size by 2 makes it twice as large.

### Why Are Vector Images Important?

Vector images are everywhere! They are used in:

- **Logos**: Companies use vector graphics so their logos stay sharp and clear no matter how big or small they are.
- **Cartoons**: Animators use vector graphics to create smooth, colorful characters.
- **Maps**: Roads and locations can be resized perfectly for any screen size.

Because vector images are created with math, theyâ€™re smaller in file size and easier to edit than regular images made of pixels.

### Try Making Your Own Vector Shapes!

Hereâ€™s a fun activity:

1. Draw a grid on paper.
2. Pick two points and connect them with a straight line.
3. Add more points and connect them to create a shape, like a triangle or a star.

If you want to get creative, imagine youâ€™re a computer and describe the shapes youâ€™re drawing using points, lines, and sizes. Thatâ€™s how vector images are made!

Math isnâ€™t just about solving equationsâ€”itâ€™s also a creative tool that helps make the graphics and animations we see every day. Maybe one day youâ€™ll create your own amazing designs using math-powered vector images! ðŸš€

## HIGH SCHOOL: How Is Math Used to Generate Vector Images?

Have you ever seen crisp, clear graphics that look perfect no matter how much you zoom in? These are called **vector images**, and theyâ€™re created using **math**! Unlike regular pictures, which are made of tiny dots (pixels), vector images are made using lines, curves, and shapes described by mathematical equations.

Letâ€™s explore how math powers these amazing images and why theyâ€™re so important in graphic design, logos, and animations!

### What Are Vector Images?

A vector image is created by combining basic geometric shapes like:

- **Lines**
- **Circles**
- **Polygons**

Each shape is described using **coordinates** and mathematical formulas instead of pixels. This means you can scale a vector image up or down infinitely without losing any quality.

For example:

- A straight line in a vector image is described by its **start point** and **end point**.
- A circle is described using its **center point** and **radius**.

These shapes are then filled with colors or patterns to create beautiful, scalable graphics.

### Math Behind Vector Images

#### 1. Using Coordinates to Place Shapes

Every vector shape starts with a point, which is described by its **coordinates** on a grid. For example, a point $$\mathbf{(x, y)}$$ tells us where to place something on a two-dimensional space.

A line is drawn by connecting two points:

- Start point: $$\mathbf{(x_1, y_1)}$$
- End point: $$\mathbf{(x_2, y_2)}$$

The formula for the line can be written as:

$$
\mathbf{y = mx + b}
$$

where:

- $$\mathbf{m}$$ is the slope of the line (how steep it is).
- $$\mathbf{b}$$ is the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis).

This math ensures the line is drawn accurately between the two points.

#### 2. Curves with BÃ©zier Equations

One of the coolest features of vector images is the ability to create **smooth curves**. These are made using something called **BÃ©zier curves**, which are powered by math.

A simple BÃ©zier curve is defined by:

- A **start point** $$\mathbf{P_0}$$
- An **end point** $$\mathbf{P_1}$$
- A **control point** $$\mathbf{P_c}$$ that shapes the curve

The equation for a BÃ©zier curve is:

$$
\mathbf{P(t) = (1-t)^2 \cdot P_0 + 2(1-t)t \cdot P_c + t^2 \cdot P_1}
$$

Here:

- $$\mathbf{t}$$ is a value between 0 and 1 that moves along the curve.
- The curve smoothly transitions from $$\mathbf{P_0}$$ to $$\mathbf{P_1}$$ based on $$\mathbf{P_c}$$.

By adjusting the control point, designers can create arcs, loops, and other smooth shapes.

#### 3. Transformations: Rotating, Scaling, and Moving Shapes

In vector graphics, math is also used to **transform** shapes. For example:

- **Scaling**: Making a shape larger or smaller.
- **Rotation**: Turning a shape around a point.
- **Translation**: Moving a shape to a new location.

These transformations use matrices, which are mathematical grids that adjust the coordinates of points.

For example, to rotate a point $$\mathbf{(x, y)}$$ around the origin by an angle $$\mathbf{\theta}$$, the new coordinates $$\mathbf{(x', y')}$$ are calculated as:

$$
\mathbf{
\begin{aligned}
x' &= x \cdot \cos(\theta) - y \cdot \sin(\theta) \\
y' &= x \cdot \sin(\theta) + y \cdot \cos(\theta)
\end{aligned}
}
$$

This math allows vector graphics to be manipulated with precision.

### Why Are Vector Images Important?

Vector images are used in:

- **Logos**: They stay sharp no matter how much you zoom in.
- **Animations**: Smooth movements and transformations.
- **Maps**: Roads and locations can scale perfectly for any screen size.

Because vector images are based on math, theyâ€™re smaller in file size and incredibly flexible compared to pixel-based images.

### Math in Action: Create Your Own Vector Art!

Hereâ€™s a fun challenge:

1. Draw a straight line by choosing two points and using the formula $$\mathbf{y = mx + b}$$.
2. Create a simple curve using the BÃ©zier equation.
3. Experiment with scaling or rotating your shapes using the transformation formulas.

By combining these concepts, you can create your own vector art just like graphic designers do!
