## Introduction

Watch a drone fly through a Tesla factory powered by robotic arms.

## How Robotic Arms Use Math

Imagine a robotic arm as a fancy crane made of connected pieces (called links) that move at joints. These arms can pick up and place objects very precisely, and to do that, they use a lot of math. Let's break it down and make it simple!

### **How Robotic Arms Work**

1. **Positioning:** The arm needs to figure out _where_ to go. For example, "How do I move my hand to pick up the ball at $$\mathbf{(5, 3)}$$?"
2. **Moving the Joints:** The joints need to turn at just the right angles to make the hand end up in the right spot.

To solve these problems, robots use a type of math called **kinematics**. Specifically, we’re going to focus on **inverse kinematics**.

### **Forward Kinematics (Easier)**

Forward kinematics is like telling the robot: "If I move these joints by these angles, where will the hand end up?"

For example:

- Imagine a robotic arm with two segments, each $$\mathbf{4}$$ units long.
- If the first joint rotates $$\mathbf{\theta_1 = 45^\circ}$$ and the second joint rotates $$\mathbf{\theta_2 = 30^\circ}$$, you can calculate where the hand ends up using trigonometry.

The position of the hand $$\mathbf{(x, y)}$$ is:

$$
\mathbf{x = L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}
$$

$$
\mathbf{y = L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}
$$

Here:

- $$\mathbf{L_1}$$ and $$\mathbf{L_2}$$ are the lengths of the arm's segments.
- $$\mathbf{\theta_1}$$ and $$\mathbf{\theta_2}$$ are the angles of the joints.

### **Inverse Kinematics (What We Need)**

Now imagine this: Instead of knowing the angles of the joints, we tell the robot, "I want the hand to be at $$\mathbf{(5, 3)}$$. How should you move your joints?"

This is trickier because the robot has to "work backward" to figure out the angles that will make its hand land at $$\mathbf{(5, 3)}$$.

---

### **How the Math Works**

To find the angles, the robot solves these equations:

$$
\mathbf{x = L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}
$$

$$
\mathbf{y = L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}
$$

The robot rearranges these equations to calculate:

1. The angle of the first joint ($$\mathbf{\theta_1}$$).
2. The angle of the second joint ($$\mathbf{\theta_2}$$).

One way to do this is to use **arctan** (a function on your calculator that finds angles from slopes):

$$
\mathbf{\theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{x^2 + y^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}\right)}
$$

$$
\mathbf{\theta_1 = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) - \arctan\left(\frac{L_2 \sin(\theta_2)}{L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)}\right)}
$$

---

### **Simple Example**

Let’s say the robot arm has two segments of $$\mathbf{4}$$ units each ($$\mathbf{L_1 = L_2 = 4}$$), and we want the hand to be at $$\mathbf{(5, 3)}$$.

1. First, find the distance from the base to the target:

$$
\mathbf{d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{5^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{25 + 9} = \sqrt{34}}
$$

2. Solve for $$\mathbf{\theta_2}$$:

$$
\mathbf{\theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{5^2 + 3^2 - 4^2 - 4^2}{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 4}\right)}
$$

3. Solve for $$\mathbf{\theta_1}$$ similarly.

### **Why It’s Cool**

By solving these equations, the robot figures out exactly how to move its "elbow" and "shoulder" so the "hand" ends up exactly where you want. It’s like giving GPS directions to the arm!

The same math is used in video games, animation, and even space robots like the ones on Mars. It’s all about using math to make movement precise and predictable!
